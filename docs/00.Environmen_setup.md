# 0. Setup working environment on HPC
# 0. Prerequisites

For Windows users, we suggest to use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/downloads.php) and PuTTY.
Alternatively, on Windows 10 one may try to use WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux (see installation guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10))

For Linux and Mac users, it would be possible to use terminal emulator (e.g., `bash`).

We'll run analysis on the [Rocket Cluster](https://hpc.ut.ee/en/resources/rocket-cluster-en/) of the University of Tartu.

Connect to HPC:
```bash
ssh USER@rocket.hpc.ut.ee
```
(substitute `USER` with your login).

To install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html) run the following code:
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
~/miniconda/bin/conda init bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
