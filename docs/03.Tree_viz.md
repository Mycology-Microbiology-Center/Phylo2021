# 4. Visualization of phylogenetic trees: preparation

## A. Setting up an RStudio project

For convenience, we suggest working with R from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Before starting, make a directory for your project, create folder ``data`` inside of it, and put two trees and tables for label renaming in ``data``. Then, in R-Studio go to ``File -> New Project -> Existing Directory`` and select the parental directory you've just created. To make a place for your code, go ``File -> New File -> R Script`` and save it in the project directory.

## B. Importing trees to the R environment

To handle trees we will primarily use popular packages [`treeio`](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/treeio) (for tree import and format conversions) and [`ggtree`](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/) (for visualizations). For documentation on these, see https://yulab-smu.top/treedata-book/index.html. `ggtree` produces plots using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) capabilities and syntax. We also will use a few functions from [`ape`](https://github.com/emmanuelparadis/ape) and [`geiger`](https://github.com/mwpennell/geiger-v2) - two other widely used phylogenetic packages. If you do not have them installed, it can be done as follows:

````rscript
install.packages(c('ape', 'ggplot2', 'geiger'))

## ggtree and treeio come through Bioconductor:
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c('treeio', 'ggtree'))
````

Load packages:
````rscript
library(treeio)
library(ggtree)
library(ape)
library(ggplot2)
library(geiger)
````

### Tree import

Read maximum likelihood tree with bootstraps (RAxML-NG) and Bayesian tree with posterior probabilities (MrBayes). Later we will use Bayesian tree as a basis of visualization, and RAxML-NG tree to obtain bootstrap values. 

````rscript
bootTree <- read.newick ('data/tree_raxml.nwk')
bayesTree <- read.nexus ('data/tree_mrbayes.nex')
````

Bayesian tree file includes 2 trees: first with posteriors, and second without them (topology only). We will operate on the first.
````rscript
bayesTree <- bayesTree[[1]]
````

### Visual check of the trees

Here you can see a typical ``ggplot2``-styled syntax defining parts of the graph. ``ggtree`` itself draws a naked tree, ``geom_tiplab`` adds labels to tips, ``geom_text2`` adds text to the plot  - in this case support values stored in ``label`` field, and ``xlim`` is needed to shrink tree horizontally, to avoid truncation of long labels.

````rscript
ggtree(bootTree) +
  geom_tiplab() +
  geom_text2(
    aes(label = label, subset = !isTip),
    hjust = 1.3,
    vjust = -0.4,
    size = 2
  ) +
  xlim(0, 0.3)

ggtree(bayesTree) +
  geom_tiplab() +
  geom_text2(
    aes(label = round(as.numeric(label), 2), subset = !isTip),
    hjust = 1.3,
    vjust = -0.4,
    size = 2
  ) +
  xlim(0, 0.3)
  ````
  
## C. Detour: how to deal with default formatting of MrBayes files

TL;DR: Default MrBayes/BEAST output needs special transformations in R for downstream plotting. If you brought your own trees made before workshop, you likely need to read this.

Newick and NEXUS are the most common tree formats, and in both of them any internal-node-associated data (like bootstraps) can be stored as node _names_. In this case, it's safe to read a tree in a simple ``phylo`` format. Though, many Bayesian programs produce a complex output that cannot fit in the node names, and instead they write it in node _comments_. Here, using ``phylo`` may result in a loss of comments (``node.label`` will be absent). So it's better to employ more sophisticated formats: e.g. ``treedata`` used by ``treeio``/``ggtree``. To make sure comments are not lost, do not use generic ``read.nexus``, but try to find a function designed specifically for your program (see https://yulab-smu.top/treedata-book/chapter1.html). 

MrBayes by default saves trees in a format friendly for FigTree (``conformat=Figtree`` in MrBayes block), where posteriors are stored in comments (see square brackets in NEXUS). For this workshop we are not interested in FigTree compatibility, so we used comments-free ``conformat=simple``. Though, your older trees may have been formatted for FigTree, and to read these properly, execute:

````rscript
bayesTree2 <- read.mrbayes ('data/tree_mrbayes_figtree.nex')
````

This will produce a ``treedata`` object, that consists mainly of 2 parts: familiar ``phylo`` part with tree topology, and ``data`` with MrBayes-specific data including posteriors. Importantly, our plotting routine requires posteriors _inside_ of ``phylo``, and we achieve this with the following. (Below is MrBayes version, but it's easy to adjust for BEAST)

````rscript
## Sort nodes in data to match node order in phylo.
bayesTree@data <-
  bayesTree@data[order(as.numeric(bayesTree@data$node)), ]
  
## Write posteriors as node labels. If tree is already rooted, do not append '' to vector. 
bayesTree@phylo$node.label <-
  append ('', as.vector(subset(
    bayesTree@data$prob,
    as.numeric(bayesTree@data$node) > length(bayesTree@phylo$tip.label)
  )))
  
## Translate treedata into phylo.
bayesTree <- as.phylo(bayesTree)
````
Alternatively, you can convert your trees from nexus to newick without loosing probabilites with user-friendly free software [TreeGraph](http://treegraph.bioinfweb.info/).

## D. Rerooting

A common practice is to reroot a tree on outgroup. For the next step we need to root both trees. To do so, you need to know either:
1. Labels of outgroup taxa, or 
2. An ID of a node joining all the taxa belonging to the outgroup.

### 1. Rerooting by specifying outgroup labels

````rscript
## Bayesian tree:
bayesTree_rooted <-
  ape::root(bayesTree,
            outgroup = c('MM35985', 'MYX328'),
            edgelabel = TRUE)
            
## Same for ML tree:
bootTree_rooted <-
  ape::root(bootTree,
            outgroup = c('MM35985', 'MYX328'),
            edgelabel = TRUE)            
````

Note: ``edgelabel = T`` is essential for correct label placement, otherwise labels can slip to wrong branches. For details see [Czech et al. 2017 "A Critical Review on the Use of Support Values in Tree Viewers and Bioinformatics Toolkits"](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msx055).

### 2. Rerooting by specifying node ID

If outgroup is large, the option with node ID may save you some typing. The easiest way to locate needed ID is to plot all of them (here on example of the Bayesian tree).

````rscript
ggtree(bayesTree) +
  geom_tiplab() +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = node),
    hjust = 1.3,
    vjust = 1.3,
    size = 2,
    color = 'red'
  ) +
  xlim(0, 0.3)
````

If your tree is large and crowded, it may be difficult to visually spot the desired node. Another way is to make a table from the tree, find a taxon from the outgroup and trace node-to-node connections down to the common node of all outgroup taxa. 

````rscript
bayesTree_tib <- as_tibble(bayesTree)
````
In this case it's node 89:

````rscript
bayesTree_rooted <- ape::root(bayesTree, node = 89, edgelabel = TRUE)
````

### Check the result 

````rscript
ggtree(bootTree_rooted) +
  geom_tiplab() +
  geom_text2(
    aes(label = round(as.numeric(label), 2), subset = !isTip),
    hjust = 1.3,
    vjust = -0.4,
    size = 2
  ) +
  xlim(0, 0.3)

ggtree(bayesTree_rooted) +
  geom_tiplab() +
  geom_text2(
    aes(label = round(as.numeric(label), 2), subset = !isTip),
    hjust = 1.3,
    vjust = -0.4,
    size = 2
  ) +
  xlim(0, 0.3)
````

## E. Combine bootstraps and posteriors

### Set up a function

The `getSupports` function compares all the subclades in the Bayes tree to all the subclades in the bootstrap tree, and vice versa, and identifies all those clades that are identical. It produces a data frame `supportsTable` with node IDs and their respective bootstraps for further use in ggtree.
The function originates from [Ordynets A., 2018](https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.n9fdh3n) with slight changes by Yatsiuk I.

````rscript
getSupports <- function(primaryTree, secondaryTree)
{
  ## The getAllSubTrees subfunction below atomizes a tree into each individual
  ## subclade, so then we can compare and match these subclades between our 2 trees.
    getAllSubtrees <- function(phy, minSize = 2)
  {
    res <- list()
    count = 1
    ntip <- length(phy$tip.label)
    for (i in 1:phy$Nnode)
    {
      l <- tips(phy, ntip + i)
      bt <- match(phy$tip.label, l)
      if (sum(is.na(bt)) == 0)
      {
        st <- phy
      }
      else
        st <- drop.tip(phy, phy$tip.label[is.na(bt)])
      if (length(st$tip.label) >= minSize)
      {
        res[[count]] <- st
        count <- count + 1
      }
    }
    res
  }
  getAllSubtrees(primaryTree) -> primarySub
  getAllSubtrees(secondaryTree) -> secondarySub
  supportsList <- matrix('-', Nnode(primaryTree), 1)
  for (i in 1:Nnode(primaryTree))
  {
    for (j in 1:Nnode(secondaryTree))
    {
      match(primarySub[[i]]$tip.label[order(primarySub[[i]]$tip.label)], secondarySub[[j]]$tip.label[order(secondarySub[[j]]$tip.label)]) -> shared
      match(secondarySub[[j]]$tip.label[order(secondarySub[[j]]$tip.label)], primarySub[[i]]$tip.label[order(primarySub[[i]]$tip.label)]) -> shared2
      if (sum(is.na(c(shared, shared2))) == 0)
      {
        secondaryTree$node.label[j] -> supportsList[i]
        supportsTable <-
          data.frame(min(as.data.frame(primaryTree[["edge"]])$V1):max(as.data.frame(primaryTree[["edge"]])$V1),
                     supportsList)
        rownames(supportsTable) <- NULL
        colnames(supportsTable) <- c("node", "bootstrap")
      }
    }
  }
  supportsTable <<- supportsTable
}
````

Apply function to our trees, where ``primaryTree`` is what we want to plot in the end:

````rscript
getSupports(primaryTree = bayesTree_rooted, secondaryTree = bootTree_rooted)
````
