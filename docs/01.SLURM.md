# 2. Slurm, the workload manager

The Slurm Workload Manager, a.k.a. Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM), is used to share the HPC resources between users.

Please note, that users login from their computers to the cluster **head node**.<br/>
**Do not run the analysis on the head node!**<br/>
You should use it only to schedule the tasks that would be distributed on the **cluster nodes**.
